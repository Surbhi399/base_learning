    <p>Backend web development is the part of web development that deals with the server-side of a web application. This includes creating and managing the server-side logic, connecting the application to a database, creating server-side APIs, handling user authentication and authorization, and processing and responding to user requests. It often involves the use of programming languages such as Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, JavaScript (Node.js), and .NET languages.

        A backend developer is responsible for the development of server-side components of a web application i.e. working with databases, handling requests, creating server-side APIs that can be consumed by frontend developers to retrieve and manipulate data, ensuring the scalability of the systems i.e. making sure that the backend can handle a high volume of traffic and is performant, integrating external services like payment gateways, message queues, cloud services, etc.</p>
